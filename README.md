## About the Project

Meteora is a fictitious e-commerce landing page that highlights sustainability and timeless fashion. The site was created to practice **responsive design** with Bootstrap's **Grid System**, **Components**, and **Utilities**, ensuring usability across various screen sizes. 

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:
- **HTML5**: For semantic structure and content organization.
- **CSS3**: For additional styles and customizations.
- **Bootstrap 5**: The main framework used for building a responsive and consistent design. Key tools and features implemented in this project include:
  - **Grid System**: Utilized `container`, `row`, and `col-*` classes to create a flexible and responsive layout. Columns were adjusted for different screen sizes using classes like `col-6`, `col-md-4`, and `col-xxl-2`.
  - **Navbar**: Implemented using `navbar`, `navbar-expand-md`, `bg-black`, and `navbar-dark` classes to create a responsive navigation bar with a dropdown menu for smaller screens.
  - **Carousel**: Used the `carousel`, `carousel-item`, `carousel-inner`, and `carousel-indicators` classes to create a responsive image slider that adapts to different screen sizes with specific images for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
  - **Cards**: Designed product cards using `card`, `card-header`, `card-body`, and other utility classes for content organization and styling.
  - **Buttons**: Styled buttons with classes like `btn`, `btn-primary`, and custom classes like `rounded-0` and `border-0` for specific aesthetic adjustments.
  - **Forms**: Built a subscription form using `form-control`, `input-group`, and `btn` classes to ensure consistent styling and usability.
  - **Icons**: Integrated Bootstrap Icons (`bi`) to enhance the UI with vector icons, such as in the "facilities" section.
  - **Typography Utilities**: Applied utility classes like `fw-bold`, `text-center`, and `text-bg-dark` for text alignment, weight, and background contrast.
  - **Spacing Utilities**: Used classes like `my-3`, `px-3`, and `g-4` to adjust margins, paddings, and gaps, ensuring consistent spacing across elements.
  - **Custom Colors**: Extended Bootstrap's styling with custom classes, such as `verde-limao` and `botao-lilas`, defined in the CSS file.
